			<h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a verity of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="topic">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="blue">var x;</span></li>
					<li><span class="topic">Variable Assignemt</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a varialble. <span class="blue">var x = 10;</span></li>
					<li><span class="topic">Data Types</span> Data types are in an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six sata types that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean- <span class="blue">true</span> or <span class="blue">false;</span> null- null aka nothing; Number - <span class="blue">42</span> or <span class="blue">3.14159;</span> String-<span class="blue">"Conding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array-<span class="blue">[1,'Coding, 2, 'Dojo']</span> and Object - <span class="blue">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'doe'}</span></li>
					<li><span class="topic">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="blue">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="blue">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="blue">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><span class="topic">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some numver of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around he track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
					<li><span class="topic">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of code block. When call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! we finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over an dover and over again.</li>
